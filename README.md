# 🏈QB ANALYSIS DETAILS🏈

## 💪1. Motivation behind the project and problem definition💪
   
    As I have been getting more familiar with the world of AI/machine learning, I wanted to build a project 
    where I could combine my passion for sports with my love for creation and engineering. 
    As a 49ers fan, I watched my team spend 3 first round picks to trade up and select Trey Lance, a dual-threat 
    FCS national champion who led his team to an undefeated season while contributing 42 total touchdowns with 0 interceptions.
    Fast forward to today, and Trey Lance is rotting as a backup in LA after a failed stint with the 49ers. 
    On the other hand, with the very last pick in the 2022 NFL draft, the 49ers selected Brock Purdy, a senior from 
    a middle-of-the-pack BIG12 school who had just come off a 4-8 season.
    Once again, fast forward to today, and this once-overlooked kid now has a 265 million dollar contract 
    and is thriving on one of the NFL’s most storied franchises.
    With so many other examples of situations almost identical to this, I set out to see if I could find a 
    true pattern behind what separates QBs who become NFL stars, and those who become labeled as draft busts.
